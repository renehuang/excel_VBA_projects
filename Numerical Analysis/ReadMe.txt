These spreadsheets are made for my 'numerical analysis' coursework. 

Not correct answer! Small errors! DO NOT COPY

1. Option Greeks:

Make an Excel spreadsheet that does the following: 
1). User inputs to calculate option greeks and do the plot
2). Outputs: Value, Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Phi (rate of change of value with respect to change of foreign interest rate), Rho (rate of change of value with respect to change of domestic interest rate) of the call option 
3). The spreadsheet could graph according to user inputs






2. Interpolation (Linear/ polynomial/ cubic spline)

Using the given market data of the volatility smile by delta to compute & plot different interpolation vols

1). the linear interpolated vol 
2). the polynomial interpolated vol using Neville’s algorithm 
3). the cubic spline interpolated vol 
4). Produce the graphs

For the cubic spline, user will control the “2 degree of freedom”. (Natural Spline, given first derivatives & given second derivatives)







3. Implied Volatility

Using numerical methods to solve out the implied volatility of BS model (knowing option value/ portfolio value)
Discuss the convergence of each method

1). Newton's Method
2). Regula Falsi Method
3). Secant Method



4. Finite Difference Method

Using the finite difference method to solve the Option value. Compare the value with BSM formula and plot the PDE discrepency.
