This analysis is based on the Shortex long & short strategy recommendation report, which will recommend twice a month with 7 long stocks and 7 short stocks.
The recommendation report will give out suggesting buying range (build the position if price falls into this range) and stop loss point.

According to the report & using data from Bloomberg, created Excel VBA files to calculate the return of these recommendations, to give a rough evaluation of the recommdation strategy.

The calculation process is included in 'Shortex_16_calculation.xlsx' and the final result is collected in 'shortex_16_result.xlsx'
